# Pleiad

Pleiad (pronounced PLEE-ad) is an **Agentic SDLC**: a public Codex plugin for repository-native, issue-driven software delivery. Its name is new; the product category and methodology are unchanged.

Pleiad installs reusable workflows while keeping project knowledge in the repository. It provides complete role contracts, versioned structured handoffs, resilient cross-task recovery, selective ADR discovery, deterministic upgrades, and a one issue = one delivery cell = one writable Implementation worktree/branch = one PR model; QA and Reviewer use distinct subordinate, non-authoritative tasks/workspaces.

## Install during development

See [installation](docs/installation.md) for local and version-pinned Git-backed marketplace examples. Public-directory distribution will be added after the package has been validated through the OpenAI submission process.

## Use

- Invoke `bootstrap-pleiad` in a repository that has not adopted the workflow.
- Invoke `coordinate-pleiad` to route durable role work, read-only research, corrections, or uncertain cross-task delivery.
- Invoke `adr-context` when a task may be constrained by architectural decisions.
- Invoke `upgrade-pleiad` after installing a newer plugin release.

Bootstrap and upgrade always inspect first, report a deterministic dry run, preserve project-owned content, stop on managed drift or ambiguous ownership, and require explicit approval before repository writes. Apply is idempotent and followed by a drift check.

See [upgrading](docs/upgrading.md) for the two-layer plugin and repository migration model.
See the [GPT-6 model migration plan](docs/pleiad/model-migration-plan.md) for model-routing evaluation and rollout.

See the managed [coordination policy](docs/pleiad/coordination.md), [role contracts](docs/pleiad/role-contracts.md), and [native task-boundary hook guardrails](docs/pleiad/hooks.md) for the native delivery-cell model: Coordinator supervises a dedicated Implementation, QA, and Reviewer cell while GitHub remains the durable authority.

## Development

Run:

```text
python scripts/validate.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Pull requests target `main`. Only the repository owner may merge. Versions are sourced from `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`; merging a previously unreleased version to `main` creates the corresponding GitHub release. Pleiad starts at `0.1.0` and advances through deliberately small patch releases (`0.1.1`, `0.1.2`, and so on); changing the minor or major component requires explicit repository-owner direction.

## Self-hosting

This repository dogfoods Pleiad. Release pull requests update both the plugin manifest and the repository's applied version; only the owner may merge, and the matching stable release is then published automatically.
